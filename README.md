# PyMark: CPU Benchmark Tool
## Processor efficiency calculator utilising the Sieve of Eratosthenes

Uses prime number generation algorithm 'Sieve of Eratosthenes' to measure the time taken to generate the primes. Gives a general an idea on your CPU's computational capabilities.
Results are based on an average of `7500000` iterations for the short test and `92500000` for the regular test
