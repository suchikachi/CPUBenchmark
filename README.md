# PyMark: CPU Benchmark Tool
## Processor efficiency calculator utilising the Sieve of Eratosthenes

Uses prime number generation algorithm 'Sieve of Eratosthenes' to measure the time taken to generate the primes.  Results are based on how long it takes for your processor to generate all prime values up to `7500000` for the short test and `92500000` for the regular test
Gives a general an idea on your CPU's computational capabilities
